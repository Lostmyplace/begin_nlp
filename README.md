# A curated list of beginner resources in Natural Language Processing

## How this list got started

On November 10, 2016, a Hacker News (HN) user aarohmankad asked the HN community for suggestions on beginner NLP resources. This [Ask HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12916498) became popular and stayed in the front page for some time. In this time, it gathered plenty of community generated suggestions about beginner NLP resources. This list is an attempt to summarize this discussion into a coherent list of resources. I also wrote a [blog post](https://medium.com/ask-hn-summaries/how-to-get-into-natural-language-processing-2011bf9f4cfe#.szm4ljj93) on this.

## Online University Courses

* [Machine Translation course at the University of Pennsylvania](http://mt-class.org/penn/)

## Packages to Play With

* [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) : Most popular NLP library in Python. Excellent documentation in the form of a [book](http://amzn.to/2fdaYie)/[free online version](http://nltk.org/book). Powerful and extensible.
* [Stanford CoreNLP](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) : Fast and feature rich NLP library, written in JAVA. An online demo is available [here](http://corenlp.run).
* [Spacy](https://spacy.io/) : Another emerging NLP library in Python. Fast and state of the art. Tries to maintain an uniform API while implementing state of the art algorithms. They have a [blog](http://explosion.ai) and an [online demo](https://demos.explosion.ai/displacy/).
* [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) : Offers an unified interface for extracting text data and meta data from many different file formats (PPT, PDF etc.) and analysis.

## Academic Papers

* [Deep Learning in NLP](https://github.com/andrewt3000/dl4nlp) : A GitHub repo that collects papers on Deep Learning in NLP.

## Learning by Doing

Often the best way to learn is to contribute to an existing open source NLP project or implementing a fun idea. 

### Open Source Projects

* [Betty](https://github.com/pickhardt/betty) : Betty is a open source project with both real-life use and practical NLP considerations, and is looking for new maintainers.

### Fun Ideas

* [Interactive Fiction/Parser Based Fiction](http://iftechfoundation.org/frequently-asked-questions/) : A video game where the player's interactions primarily involve text. Listen to this illuminating [FLOSS podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSr4okYxwjk) on the topic.

## APIs

* [IBM Watson Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/) : From the makers of [IBM Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)). It lets you integrate NLP functionality in your app via an API. There's a free tier/free trial.

## User Groups

* [ACM Special Interest Group in AI](https://sigai.acm.org/index.html) : If you are craving for some face to face human contact.

## Other Guides

* [Quora question on how to get into NLP](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-Natural-Language-Processing)
* [awesome-nlp on GitHub](https://github.com/keonkim/awesome-nlp) : A GitHub repo containing a curated list of NLP resources.
